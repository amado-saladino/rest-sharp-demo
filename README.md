# Rest Sharp
The work here has been implemented using this [article
](http://sudiptachaudhari.com/generic-rest-client-in-csharp/) as well as this [repo
](https://github.com/sudipta-chaudhari/GenericRestClient_CSharp). Some modifications were added to the Utility and Test Methods.
This [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-2e5KpjOA&list=PL6tu16kXT9PrnRtsbMjadSzrM0f43Nx8W) is also a reference for this demo.


### Fake API

 - Local version [json-server
](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
 - Online version of [JSONPlaceholder
](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

### Run
Open Powershell to the solution root folder and run:
```
.\packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.10.0\tools\nunit3-console.exe .\RestSharpDemo\bin\Debug\RestSharpDemo.dll
```
Good luck for all :)
